# Hydroelectric-Dam-Prediction-using-Neural-Network-and-Fuzzy-Logic
This project is essentially a simulation of hydroelectric dam created on MATLAB ,to predict the electricity supplied by hydroelectric dam by forecasting the next hour electricity demand based on three hours previous demand (IESO Canada Power Usage Dataset) using Neural Network (NN) and Fuzzy Logic (FL). After benchmarked various NN architecture and activation function, the NN selected is Bayesian Regularization back propagation architecture, with hyperbolic transfer function as hidden layer and linear function as the output layer for the activation function . FL on the other hand is based on Sugeno's inference engine, and Triangulated as the membership function.
